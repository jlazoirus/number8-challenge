# number8-challenge
Quick react challenge made with react.
Detailed Requirements:
1. Allow the user to specify three inputs: A Start Date​, the Number of
days to display and a Country Code literal (the country code literal
value must be defined by the user with the keyboard).
  Example:
    Start Date: 8/15/2008
    Number of days: 17
    Country Code: US
    
2. Render a calendar that spans as many weeks as necessary in order to
cover the defined number of days. If the date range spans months, a
new header needs to be created for that month. The Calendar should
display its days starting on Sunday and ending on Saturday, as shown
below. This should work with any number of days regardless of the
years meaning that if the user specifies more than 365 days, calendars
will be generated accordingly for the next year and so on.

3. The days should be color coded as follows (they must match the
picture above):
   A. Weekends are yellow​.
   B. Weekdays are green​.
   C. Invalid days are hidden and the background should be gray​.
  Invalid days are defined as:
   D. Any days in the week previous to the Start date.
   E. Any days in the week after the last rendered day.
   F. Any days before the first day of the month (if the calendar spills into another month).
